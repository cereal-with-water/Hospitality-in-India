India has the largest pollution-related death toll in the world (Hayward, 2021). 
We hypothesized that an increase of factors such as AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO, ozone, temperature and humidity will lead to higher hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in Punjab, India. 
We also considered socioeconomic factors in the region of where the hospital is located (Ludhiana) as contributors to the higher hospital admissions rates.
