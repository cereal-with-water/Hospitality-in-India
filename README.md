India has the largest pollution-related death toll in the world (Hayward, 2021).
We hypothesized that an increase of factors such as AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO, ozone, temperature and humidity will lead to higher hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in Punjab, India.
We also considered demographic factors of mortalities in Ludhiana, the subregion where our dataset hospital is located.
